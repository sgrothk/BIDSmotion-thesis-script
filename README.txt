This repo contains wrapper input and custom preprocessing scripts for two example data sets 
which have been converted to BIDS for motion based on the BEP029 (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaaLKgWjK5pcISD1MVxHKexB3PZWfE2aAC5HF_pCZWo/edit#heading=h.w5vg69wsp4vc).
The data sets have been created for the master thesis:
